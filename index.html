            The autonomous delivery bots combines healthy snack options and advanced innovation, said Scott Finlow, 
            vice president of Innovation and Insights, PepsiCo Foodservice. “Snackbot is the next generation of us delivering convenient, 
            healthier products,” Finlow told USA Today. “It represents a really important intersection of consumer demands and needs and also 
            the evolution of technology.”
            <br>
            University of Pacific staff, faculty, and students can use a snackbot app to order food and drinks from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
             and there are more than 50 designated delivery areas on the university’s 175-acre campus. The snack costs, and fees
              associated with the service, were not released.</p>
