        <p>Our company was established in 2000 and we have been very blessed to have a great start up in our company and everyone has been pushing us and using the SnackBots. Our community drives us to be even better than before.</p>
        <p>We have also been able to push our products to 3 different countries. We have been through a few rough patches with having some vulnerable software, but that was discovered and patched very quickly. We can assure you our SnackBots are secure and further vulnerabilities have been resolved.</p>
